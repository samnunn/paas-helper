# [Gas Notes: Clinic Helper](https://clinic.gasnotes.net) ðŸ˜´
This is a little web app to help perioperative doctors get through their clinic days. The key features are:

- **Structured data entry** to make sure you get everything you need
- **Embedded calculators** for a few risk scoring tools
    - Apfel Score
    - RCRI
    - STOP-BANG
    - SORT Score
- **Archiving functionality** to download a nice little markdown summary of your appointment
- **Deep links** to commonly-used clinical applications (UMRN required)

There are also some smarts about piping demographic and anthropometric data into score calculators automatically. Everything is done locally, on-device.

## SORT Score
Many perioperative doctors use the [SORT Score](http://sortsurgery.com) for decision-making about perioperative management. The official site is rather clunky, and its server-side component (on which it is totally dependent) is, as far as I can tell, written in awfully-slow R.

To speed things along, I re-implemented the score to run inside the browser tab (along with a few other conveniences, like alphabetising the options). It's lighting fast now. Many thanks to SORT Score contributor [Dr Danny J. Wong](https://dannyjnwong.github.io/about/) for publishing their original [R implementation](https://github.com/dannyjnwong/SORTWebCalc_dev).
